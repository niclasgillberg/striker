# Striker

In ancent times when dragons still ruled the skies, 
the metalsmiths were the equivalent of nowadays developers. 
They crafted everything from the most beautiful things to the most powerful,
and generously gave it all away to the commoners to enlighten their petty lives.

Since the metalsmiths were as lazy as developers are today, they had helpers to 
do all the heavy work. These helpers were the Strikers.

Ok, that is not 100% accurate but strikers are actually real, 
and has given name to this very application. 

In order to help developers so generously spread their knowledge around 
the interwebz, Striker does the heavy lifting for blogging using static site generators, 
like [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and [Metalsmith](http://www.metalsmith.io/).
